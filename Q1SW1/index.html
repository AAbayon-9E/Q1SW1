			<br/>â‹†.à³ƒà¿”*:ï½¥<br/><em>League of Legends</em> is a famous MOBA game that has tons of players battling against eachother. Consisting of more <br/>than 100 champions you can play as while each of them contain a <em>unique kit of skills<br/> and gameplay</em> that fits your playstyle. Although it seems like a simple game where you fight<br/> against eachother in a team of two, <mark>The Lore</mark> behind League of Legends says otherwise which i will focus more on.<p/>

		     <p style="color:#F3D34A;  text-align: center;">The land of <strong>Runeterra</strong> is a place of many stories. Where the characters from the game <br/>live their lives which is why they are full of diversity â€” their culture, personality, and skills. <br/>Each place brings in new environments and communities.<p/>

			<!-- UNORDERED LIST  -->
		<br>
			<ul>
				<h2 style="color:#FF72E0;">â‹†âœ©ï½¡Â°â‹†<a href="https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_GB/story/champion/Zoe/" target="_blank">Zoe</a>â‹†ï½¡Â°âœ©</h2> 
				<img src="https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Zoe_0.jpg" width="450">
				<ul type="square" style="color:#A3ACFF;">
					<li>
						her hit-and-run playstyle, which is related with portals since <br/>she can travel between dimensions, is <mark>fun and satisfying</mark> because<br/> it catches the enemies off-guard. 
					</li>
				
				<br/>
					
					<li>
						i like her bubbly and silly personality since it<br/> makes me giggle and i somewhat relate to it.
					</li>
				
				<br/>
					
					<li>
						i find her design unique and <mark>i like her color pallete</mark> since it <br/>is related to the stars as she is called the <em>aspect of twilight.</em>
					</li>
			</ul>
		<br> 
			<ul>
				<h2 style="color:#00C479;">â‹†à¼º<a href="https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_GB/story/champion/Kalista/" target="_blank">Kalista</a>à¼»â‹†</h2> 
			<img src="https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Kalista_0.jpg" width="450">
			<ul type="square" style="color:#3BDEFF;">
				<li>
					I barely play Kalista in the game but i sympathize and admire <br/>her character a lot. Being a noble woman and the general of <em>Camavor</em>, <br/>she made a lot of sacrifices to help her kingdom and her uncle <br/>(who had to become a king of their kindom on a short notice) because <br/>she had a better vision of <em>Camavor</em>, trying to make it into a better place, <br/>only for it to fall into <mark>ruination</mark> and i think that she deserved better. 
				</li>
			<br>
				<li>
					It is cool to me that her spirit goes for <mark>people who betray another</mark> <br/>because it make sense for her character since she wants revenge and <br/>justice which rumors call her <em>the spear of vengeance</em>.
			</ul>
			<br/>
			<ul>	
					<h2 style="color:#FAAE4C;">âœ©Â°ðŸ”¥â‚ŠâŠ¹<a href="https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_GB/story/champion/milio/" target="_blank">Milio</a>âŠ¹â‚ŠðŸ”¥Â°âœ©</h2> 
				<img src="https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Milio_0.jpg" width="450">
				<ul type="square" style="color:#6FED6B;">
					<li>
						One of my mains because <mark>i love playing support and helping my allies</mark> from a distance
					</li>
				
				<br/>
					
					<li>
						In a family where they practice fire magic, he didnt like how it was destructive, therefore <br/>he created one that could heal wounds called "<em>soothing flame</em>" and his story made me realize <br/>that things don't need to be violent if you use it more carefully which made me like Milio more.
					</li>
				
				<br/>
					
					<li>
						I admire his brave and bright personality which reminds me of a <mark>gentle flame</mark>.				
					</li>
			</ul>

		<p style="color:#F3D34A; text-align: center; font-family:Times New Roman;"> I find the story of league of legends bigger than the game <br/>with things that im still finding out like the <br/>story of the characters, places, and events that occured  in <em>Runeterra</em>. <br/>(references in the ICT gdrive)
